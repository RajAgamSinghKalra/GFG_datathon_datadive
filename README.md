# **PROJECT TITLE: Predicting Obesity Levels Using Machine Learning: A Practical Guide**

The following project was created for a datathon in the timespan of 8hrs for the DATADIVE datathon. We were provided with a dataset and were asked to make an application to solve common world issues. Our dataset was based on obesity levels of individuals, with a description of lifestyle choices and habits.

There were a total of 2,111 instances and 16 features + 1 target variable. I used the RandomForestClassifier model with approximately 95% accuracy.

## **Libraries:**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- sklearn

## **How to Run:**
1. Place the obesity dataset in the same folder as the script. (I have also uploaded the dataset given for the datathon.)
2. Run the script, follow the on-screen prompts to input your data, and receive instant insights into your health!
